History becomes an integral part of it from the very inception of its design, enriched through construction, and expands even after the building’s completion. As architectural landscapes are repurposed for contemporary needs, they continue to respond to challenges and stigmas of marginalised communities. \r\n\r\nJoin us on Saturday 9th September (11am-1pm) to discuss what happens when people inhabit landscapes and new communities emerge. \r\n\r\nAs landscapes mature, we are given a choice: to ignore or embrace what came before.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when the histories of these communities are neglected?",
