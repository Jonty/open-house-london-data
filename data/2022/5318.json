                "The design intention for the London Living Room and the Committee Rooms was to lower the threshold for the public to engage with civic activities within the new City Hall. The design has been developed to allow passive views into the committee rooms from the London Living Room and also through the large LED screen which spans the whole way across Committee Rooms 1 to 4, this will communicate events, opportunities as well as celebrating public holidays. \nThe threshold between LLR and the committee rooms are a series of ‘porch’ spaces where a member of the public can view a meeting from the outside if they do not yet feel confident to enter and fully engage. The central committee rooms have a large moveable partition which  means these rooms can be combined to host much larger events.\nThe committee rooms have been designed as the home of democracy and so the material palette is one which evokes a sense of warmth, comfort and belonging – this includes timbers, brass, soft greens and glowing white light which light the rooms from the top, creating a space which feels inspiring and hopeful.",
                "The chamber has a generous triple-height volume which presents views and glimpses from much of the building.\nAs with the committee rooms, the ambition for the chamber floor was to create a space which is inviting, warm and hopeful, this is achieved through a similar palette of timbers, brass, and warm pendant lighting which is suspended from ~8metres above.\nThe approach of lowering the threshold for public participation is achieved in the vestibule and the public gallery where finishes and lighting are more subdued to allow passive engagement and observation from a place which feels relaxed.",

In total the building reduces carbon emissions by 50% when assessed against a standard benchmark building. This compares favourably with 15% reduction in the London plan for new build.",

Reflective glass is used on the backward-leaning facets to reflect the sun, while transparent glass is used on the inner faces angled towards the ground.",

                "•\tOne of the project’s key ambitions was to provide a more inclusive space for the diverse needs of Londoners, and so key design interventions were made to unlock transformative cultural improvements, such tactics included reconfigurations to incorporate gender neutral WC and shower facilities throughout as well as inclusive changing places, multi-faith and wayfinding/ signage which surpasses accessibility requirements for those with physical, visual or cognitive impairment.",
                "•\tThe design concept for the London Living Room was to create an extension of the London’s Parks. This is achieved using FSC-approved British timbers in the joinery benching and seating areas which define the space. Further to this the London Park theme is reinforced through the installation of 10 large planters, which are planted with a variety of large trees and other planting, these planters incorporate areas to sit and work while enjoying the tree’s biophilic benefits which include; \no\tImproved health.\no\tIncreased mood and feeling of well-being.\no\tImproved productivity.\no\tReduced stress levels.\no\tMental restoration & reduced fatigue.",

                "•\tThe carpets on the 1st and 2nd floors are made of recycled fishing nets as part of the Net-Works® innovative, cross-segment initiative designed to tackle the growing environmental problem of discarded fishing nets in some of the world’s poorest coastal communities.",
                "•\tThe office spaces have been designed to incorporate flexibility as much as possible to allow easy future adaptation, for example retaining moveable partitions, and incorporating dual entry to all meeting rooms to enable easy subdivision."
