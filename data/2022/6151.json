You'll see where the militancy of the suffrage movement began at the doorstep of what is now the Royal College of Nursing's Headquarters in London. You'll also hear about nurses who officially recorded themselves as 'protesting nurse suffragette' and suffragist in the 1911 census, as well as discovering some of the exclusive nursing and women's clubs of Marylebone. Booking required. Outside only, no access to building",

                "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) was founded in 1916, when Dame Sarah Swift approached MP Sir Arthur Stanley to support her in founding a College to help regulate the nursing profession and pursue educational goals. Swift was an early supporter of state registration for nurses and said that her wartime work had opened her eyes to the chaotic state of nurses’ training and the urgent need to protect the interests of nurses. Today, the RCN is both a professional organisation and a trade union, representing nearly half a million nursing staff, promoting excellence in practice and shaping health policies."

Cooper was later commissioned to integrate the two buildings with 21 Cavendish Square, and a new façade was created. The RCN as it appears from the street today was completed in 1934.",

The former integrated the buildings internally, with the imaginative addition of a five-storey glass walkway at the rear of the College, while the latter refurbishment included the development of a modern Library and Heritage Centre."
