Using a strong palette of charcoal brickwork, polished concrete, smoked oak and subtly crafted joinery, the project provides a new rich contrast to the existing London stock brickwork, painted sash windows and classic white interior detailing."

It places a window seat in a corner adjacent planted beds and brings a meandering brickwork from the back of the garden into the house via pavers, planters, piers, plinths and walls. It finally climbs to a high point within a new lightwell at the back of the new kitchen space to create a definitive connection between the old and new."
