Its collection now comprises 4,000 works of art from period views of historic London to the work of contemporary artists. Since the Second World War, the City of London’s collection has concentrated on London subjects."

The consistent Gothic feeling was nevertheless maintained by abstracted giant tracery, but the general powerful massing, achieved by consistent wall and roof planes, is perhaps more reminiscent of Lutyens. [It has a] sophisticated but most unusual design, neither modern nor postmodern ...”",

The site was subsequently declared a scheduled ancient monument – with the result that Gilbert Scott had to design the new building around the remains, which are also on show to the public."
