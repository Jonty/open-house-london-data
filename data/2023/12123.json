For him it’s a way of ensuring buildings last — what he calls an ‘aesthetic sustainability.’ Even though his buildings are comparably modest in scale, he often turns to grand structures such as palaces for inspiration, understanding that the secret of their preservation is the pleasure people take in reappropriating them from one decade to the next. After no longer fulfilling their original purpose, such buildings aren’t demolished but take on new lives: ‘They have been banks, schools, universities, dance schools, as well as the home for the very wealthy person who built it.’"
