                "Founded in 1988, 198’s motivation initially focused on the need to provide a platform for Afro-Caribbean and Asian artists as part of the Black arts movement. For 35 years this work has evolved and continued to develop with projects that consider the work and study of emerging cultural identities, through exhibitions, workshops, education projects and critical debate with artists, thinkers, activists, young people and local and artistic communities. We advocate for diversity within the visual arts and provide opportunities for those wishing to develop careers in the creative and cultural industries. In 2017, 198 achieved Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation status as part of a consortium with Photofusion.",
                "With 198’s impact in the arts, cultural and education world growing exponentially, an ambitious project was undertaken to expand and enhance its premises. This began with the purchase of the building from Lambeth Council in an Asset Transfer, and continued with major fundraising efforts resulting in obtaining £1,350,000 for a capital project which has resulted in adding two new floors to the building. This has effectively tripled the exhibition space on the ground floor, provided six new workspaces/studios for rent on the first floor, while the second floor now houses our education and enterprise programmes as well as being a space which the community can hire. Along with creating income potential to strategically underpin financial sustainability in the long term, this building allows a lifestage approach, starting with education and training for young people in creative and cultural fields, providing studios and workspaces for  creative enterprises, exhibition spaces for upcoming and established artists as well as space for hire for local, national and international events."
