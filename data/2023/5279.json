                "In October 2009 Small Earth was approached by Hounslow Heath Infantsâ€™ School in West London, UK to build an outside play dome as part of a British Airport Authority (BAA) noise attenuation scheme.",
                "The school is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is dominated by ear-deafening interruptions every 2 minutes as landing aircraft pass a few hundred feet over their heads.",
                "Sound tests inside the semi-underground dome showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise event.",
                "Work commenced in June 2010 and expanded to provide a contoured playscape for the 704 children."
