                "The environmentally efficient building has been shaped around the principles of transparency and integration, with the design bringing together numerous functions around a dramatic central atrium. At ground floor and first floor level they positioned the council’s public-facing spaces, including library and community facilities as well as a café. Large openings at street level allow these amenities to animate the building for passers-by and give it a strong civic presence.\nAbove the public-facing ground floor and first floor library are four levels of workspace for the council’s team, with the civic chamber positioned at the top of the building to benefit from views across London.\nThe project involved the relocation of the council’s headquarters to a prominent site next to Hounslow’s main high street, providing a new home for the council in the heart of the borough."
