We invite you to help us re-imagine village life and to take a walk along the banks of the River of Hope where we join hands with other community minded organisations across Camden who believe that careful and kind care is possible and are working towards creating this together. Wander in our beautiful, productive garden, have a cup of tea, meet new people and collect your River of Hope map for your onward journey. Our theme this year is S e e d s. We look forward to welcoming you"
