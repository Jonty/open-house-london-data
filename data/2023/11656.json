Visitors will be able to explore how the different spaces were used in the past, when it was a school and by Zaha Hadid Architects, and discover how they are used now by the Zaha Hadid Foundation. Information leaflets will be available to guide visitors around the ground floor. A display of handling objects related to other London School Board buildings contemporary to 10 Bowling Green Lane, and to when it was the headquarters of Zaha Hadid Architects, will be in the reception. A family workshop will take place in the gallery; people are welcome to visit the gallery to see the work created by the families."

                "This Queen Anne-style building is Grade II listed and opened in 1874 by the London School Board as the Bowling Green Lane School. The building was designed by E.R. Robson in collaboration with J.J. Stevenson. It retains much of its original Victorian layout and exterior. In the 1970s it ceased operating as a school and was divided up into artists' studios. It was once the international headquarters of Zaha Hadid Architects, beginning in 1985 when Zaha Hadid took up one of these studios. Her practice grew until it took over the whole building. Since 2022, it has been the home of the charity Zaha Hadid Foundation which is returning the building to educational uses through public exhibitions, research and a public programme of events."
