The tour explains the thought process behind the masterplan that is guiding the transformation of this post-industrial former floodplain from an idea on paper into a new metropolitan quarter of London, helping shift London’s centre of gravity eastwards.",
                "Dozens of permanent bridges built specially for the Games and Legacy help link existing communities in east London to the new parklands, permanent venues and new communities centred around the park. The setting will also be home to an exciting mix of cultural and educational venues including new homes for the London College of Fashion and BBC Music.",
                "Starting at the Timber Lodge Cafe, architects Allies and Morrison will explain the concepts that underpin the routes, open spaces and parkland that connect the new neighbourhoods to the surrounding communities. Tracing some of the most important achievements of the masterplan, such as linking Hackney and Leyton across the Lea Valley and beyond, and improving the river and canalside walks, the tour will provide insight into the urban design principles that have informed this remarkable 240 hectare redevelopment, which is anchored by the largest new public park in Europe built in the last 150 years."

And the park will soon host the most significant collection of cultural and educational buildings to be built in Britain since the Victorian era.",
                "In this film, Bob Allies (Partner of Allies and Morrison) leads a tour of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - narrating the transformation of its waterways into accessible amenity at the centre of the reshaped landscape of the Lea Valley. The tour starts in the North Park showing the mature natural landscape, the permanent venues such as the Velodrome and the residential neighbourhoods that are being established along the edges of the park. The tour then moves to the South Park with it's metropolitan character and the new cultural and educational quarter of East Bank that is beginning to take shape.",
