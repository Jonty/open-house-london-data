Upon arrival, visitors are greeted by a hand-forged wrought iron gate, before entering through a secluded cobbled courtyard, featuring a film room that introduces the \"World of Gilbert & George. A dimly lit reception area leads to three contemporary exhibition spaces of different scale and feel providing a discrete setting for the artists' large-scale creations.",
                "The Centre has been thoughtfully converted from a 1820’s former brewery building, most recently in residential use. By combining preserved, restored and contemporary elements, the project honours the building's industrial past aligning with the artists' vision of heritage, architectural spaces and art display.\nThe brief required a challenging approach to create sufficient space for the Centre's transformation on a restricted site. A new basement level was constructed under the building’s pre-existing footprint and a new above-ground side extension was added.",
                "Spitalfields has been Gilbert & George’s home and subject since the mid 1960s. The Centre is an extension of the artist’s “Art for All” ethos and aims to become a leading cultural institution - committed to free access for all members of the community - as well as providing a permanent home for an unrivalled artistic legacy by welcoming visitors from across the globe."
