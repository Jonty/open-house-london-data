Although the insulation acts as a barrier, the internal temperature can rise because of solar gain through the windows. Further passive cooling measures are planned to reduce solar gain, including a pergola at the back of the house, external blinds, and other passive shading measures such as tree planting. Cooling measures are likely to become an integral part of retrofit planning as global temperatures rise in coming years. Other future measures could include rainwater harvesting and electricity generation."
