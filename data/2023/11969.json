                "The tour follows the final section of the southern outfall sewer across the Erith marshes to the Crossness Pumping Station on the banks of the river Thames. Built by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and completed in 1865 as part of London’s first sewage system, Crossness is a masterpiece of Victorian architecture and engineering. \nThe tour charts the development of the Crossness site over its 85 years in operation: from the impact of the Princess Alice disaster to the role of the Crossness Pier and the 20th century solution to London’s waste management.\nThe walk continues along the Thames riverside path to view the current sewage treatment works and discover how London’s sewage is processed today. Then it’s back to Crossness for refreshments, followed by a look at the Tideway exhibition models to see how this new ‘super-sewer’ infrastructure is the next chapter in the story of London’s sanitation."
