                "Founded in 1694 by a Royal Charter, the Bank of England  opened for business in rented premises at Mercers Hall, in Cheapside, with just 17 clerks and 2 gatekeepers. Later that year, it moved to Grocers’ Hall in Princes Street where it stayed for 40 years.",
                "In 1734, the Bank moved to its current site in Threadneedle Street. The building was designed by George Sampson as the first purpose-built bank in Britain.",
                "Later on a new architect, Sir Robert Taylor, was hired to add new wings to each side of the building. The east wing was completed in 1765 but he couldn’t build the west wing because the church of St Christopher le Stocks stood in the way! All this changed following the Gordon Riots of 1780. Led by Lord George Gordon, a Protestant, the rioters protested against an act of parliament which reduced discrimination against British Catholics. They climbed to the top of the church spire and threw missiles into the Bank.  An Act of Parliament was passed following the incident to demolish the church. The west wing was then completed in 1798, after Taylor’s death.",
                "Next to make changes was Sir John Soane, who was one of Britain’s best known architects. He worked for the Bank for 45 years (from 1788 to 1833). Soane transformed nearly every part of Taylor’s Bank and expanded it to cover the entire 3.25 acre island site we have today.",
                "From 1925 to 1939, Sir Herbert Baker expanded the building. Baker demolished Soane’s architectural gem, and today only the huge curtain wall that surrounds the Bank survives. Baker’s Bank not only rises to 7 storeys but has 3 more floors below. Today, the Bank has more floor space below ground than most of London’s tallest skyscrapers."
