                "The shell finish allowed our customers to benefit from a highly environmentally-friendly new build on the outside while getting homes that exactly suited their needs and budget on the inside.",
                "The shells were split-level with no internal walls to create a feeling of space and flexibility and allowed the introduction of double-height voids and the maximisation of light on what is a very tight urban site. The lack of walls and landings makes the homes feel much bigger than they actually are.",
                "Each of our customers approached the fit out in a slightly different way. One did it mainly themselves with a builder, some used an architect to project manage, others project managed the build themselves."
