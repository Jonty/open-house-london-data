                "When approaching Colour Casing the Architect needed to create a scheme that enabled family living within a tight footprint without feeling compromised. The design thought beyond a conventional apartment ground floor extension to create the impression of a larger family home. Housed by an innovative cost-effective, carbon-reducing construction solution that essentially created 'a loft on the ground.'  Large format features; windows, mirrors and furniture gave the luxurious feeling of volume,  finishes and applied colour helped zone living spaces but all tie together when required, resulting in a bold but considered family home."
