                "Loop House is like a Lego box filled with colours and textures, rooms separated by portals, changing finishes and a flood of natural light. On the ground floor, we experimented with a new layout diagram that allows us to circle around the central core. The large openings between the rooms are not always aligned (like in the Mies Van der Roheâ€™s German houses), increasing the sense of surprise as we move through this narrative plan. We imagined large gatherings, long Scorsese-like camera movements through the space, and children playing hide and seek. We insulated and clad the extension in white tiles and opened it with corner sliding doors and a massive bifold window. The boundary between the garden and the house almost disappears; insects, smells, light and colours flow in and out."
