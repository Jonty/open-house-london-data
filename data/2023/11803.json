                "We are delighted to welcome members of the public to experience our beautiful and authentic Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Centre for the Open House Festival, and for visitors to discover a little about Tibetan Buddhism. The Open Day offers an opportunity to connect with ourselves  and others, relax with speciality teas, learn meditation techniques, and connect with our inner peace.",
                "The Open Day will include a schedule of events including regular meditation sessions, introductory Buddhist talks and family activities, all of which which will be led by highly experienced teachers. There will be guided tours of the shrine rooms exploring Tibetan Buddhist paraphernalia and their spiritual significance. The tearoom will be serving  homemade cakes and savouries, speciality teas and other refreshments. Visitors are also invited to browse the shop selling Buddhist books and gifts. A Buddhist film will be screened at the end of the Open Day.",
                "Who we are and what we offer",
                "Rigpa was founded in 1979 and has the gracious patronage of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and each national Rigpa association has charitable and non-profit status.",
                "Meditation and Compassion through to traditional Buddhist studies",
                "Our courses and programmes share simple meditation techniques and methods for training in compassion, which have been developed over centuries, yet help us deal with the challenges of everyday life. Meditation and compassion have been shown to be beneficial in many different ways, including bringing peace of mind, tackling stress, depression and other mental health problems. They can also help us to develop more kindness and warm-heartedness for ourselves, our families and those around us.",
                "For those who wish to go deeper into studying and practising Buddhism, Rigpa also offers study and practice programs including courses in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition of Tibet.",
                "We invite teachers of all traditions",
                "A unique feature of Rigpa UKâ€™s event programme is that it regularly hosts teachers of all Tibetan Buddhist traditions as well as Buddhist masters of other lineages, and teachers from different spiritual traditions."
