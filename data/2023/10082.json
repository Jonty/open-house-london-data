                "In 1961 a troupe of enthusiastic puppeteers under the leadership of South African master, John Wright, found a derelict temperance hall in Islington and transformed it into a magical little theatre, specially designed for children and for the presentation of marionette shows.",
                "Little Angel Theatre opened on Saturday 24th November, 1961.",
                "Over the years the theatre has been home to a wide variety of performances, showcasing numerous puppetry forms including bunraku, object theatre and black box theatre. The Marionette bridges remain, and will hopefully play a crucial role in protecting Marionette making and performance in the future as they have been recently added to the list of endangered crafts.",
                "Alongside a wide range of family activities, Little Angel Theatre also offers training in puppetry design and performance for adults."
