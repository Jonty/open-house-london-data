                "This is a deep retrofit to a 1960's terrace house, that has been carried out in several steps - the last step is being completed now, so some of the key junctions are still visible.  The heating consumption has been measured as each step has been done and had progressively come down. It is now around the Passivhaus EnePhit standard and the owners intend to get it certified. As energy use has fallen so has comfort risen and records of CO2 level, temperature and relative humidity all evidence a very high quality internally."
