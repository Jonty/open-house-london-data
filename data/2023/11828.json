                "Shortly after its closure, the hospital was taken over by Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in 1992. Since then, it has been home to the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, patient and family accommodation, and the hospital creche. In 2021 the building re-opened as the Sight and Sound Centre at GOSH, the UK’s first dedicated facility for children and young people with sight and hearing loss."
