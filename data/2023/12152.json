The project was born out of a partnership between Mission Kitchen's management team and Covent Garden Market Authority, with the intention of delivering a new space within New Covent Garden Market that could act as a platform for emerging talent in London's food and drink sector. The site was funded by the Mayor of London's regeneration fund, the Good Growth fund based on its commitment to delivering social impact by supporting early-stage businesses, creating employment and training opportunities, and championing entrepreneurs from under-represented groups."
