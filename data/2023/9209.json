                "SODA studio is an architecture practice based in Soho with many projects in the ‘village’, ranging from new-build cultural venues to repurposed Georgian townhouses. This walking tour will explore their work, as well as a few well-known landmarks, from a street-level view. It will reveal a deep love of local character and the ways that Soho is changing while retaining its distinct identity. Find out how the iconic Raymond Revuebar neon sign was saved and what happened when 76 Dean Street was ravaged by fire. It’s incredible to think that this small network of roads and alleyways is home to both neighbourhood gossip and places famous around the world."
