                "Traces of an intimate family meal are situated  at the centre of the gallery, inviting the viewer in to be part of a conversation. The stage is constructed from unassuming objects which have been carefully placed together; a table, dining chairs and crockery, framing Shakeel’s meal. The scene is dramatized by a saturation of glass crystals, propelling us to view the staples of domestic life through an altered lens.",
                "Shakeel’s meticulous work expresses a subversive, witty dialogue through sculptural form and will explore and celebrate the gregariousness of the family table. Inanimate objects become the main players, an assemblage and modern day still life scene."

Barozzi Veiga has won many international awards, including the Mies van der Rohe European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2015 for its translucent Philharmonic Hall in Szczecin, Poland."
