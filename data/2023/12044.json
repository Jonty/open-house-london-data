                "The Common Room was first imagined by a group of local residents in 2014. Torange Khonsari (Public Works) joined forces with community organisation Roman Road Trust and Clarion Housing to build a temporary, timber structure with the help of students from London Metropolitan University.",
                "From 2014 onwards, The Common Room existed as a temporary structure used for community events, workshops, meetings and gatherings. It became the base and support for many local groups and initiatives. However, whilst The Common Room was great during the warmer summer months, it was almost unusable in the autumn and winter",
                "In summer 2019, Roman Road Trust and Public Works held a series of Summer Events in The Common Room featuring skills and knowledge sharing. The popularity of these events proved there was an appetite from local people to have a weatherproof and functional building.",
                "In January 2020, Roman Road Trust launched a crowdfund campaign to transform the existing structure into a permanent space that could be used all year around.",
                "Thanks to support from local residents, businesses, and larger funders, the Crowdfund London campaign finished on 26th May 2020 with a total of £81,721 and 253 backers. Transform The Common Room was awarded the maximum pledge of £50,000 from Mayor of London.",
                "After navigating the difficulties caused to the construction industry by Covid19, Roman Road Trust and Public Works began building The Common Room in February 2023. The space is due to be completed in autumn 2023."
