                "Originally built in 1871, Cody Dock was constructed by the Imperial Chemical Company for the purpose of unloading coal from barges that was used to produce coal gas (town gas) and distribute the factory’s many by-products, such as soap and the pigment Prussian Blue. The dock was later purchased by the Gaslight and Coke Company who also owned the Beckton gasworks which became the largest gasworks in Europe. After being taken over by British Gas, the dock and its associated factory buildings fell into decline from the late 1960’s with all production coming to a close in the early 1980’s. Cody Dock and the surrounding properties were taken over by the Docklands Development Corporation in the early 90’s and much of the surrounding land was parcelled off for redevelopment into the business parks that still remain today. The dock, however, was no longer seen as being viable and was blocked off, partially filled in and converted into a balancing lagoon for surface water run-off. In November 2009 the charity Gasworks Dock Partnership was formed by local residents as a not-for-profit organisation, to provide a community led regeneration vehicle with the aim of opening up public access to the Lower Lea River and restoring the dock."

The building was designed by staff and students from the University of Westminster in collaboration with Cody Dock, OfCA and WebbYates Engineer, funded by QHT. The pavilion was designed as a lightweight timber structure with a butterfly roof, to demonstrate that plants growing and humans can happily co-exist in one space.",
                "Students took part in stakeholder engagement to better understand needs and aspirations. They then developed designs for a visionary community space based on the initial research, suitable for the local context and site. This Live Project was initiated by Maria Kramer and supported by Corinna Dean.",
                "Within the newly constructed Growing Space the Therapeutic Gardening project at Cody Dock is now underway: hosting gardening/arts and crafts activities twice a week, with the objective of improving participants’ mental and physical health and their general well-being."

Completed in 2022 the Bridge was designed by Tom Randall-Page with engineering support from Price & Myers and fabrication by Cake Industries, this contemporary bridge design is an architectural first that provides an exciting new twist on a moving bridge.\nThis project provided a unique opportunity for people to play an active role in the regeneration of Cody Dock and reactivation of the Lea River. Every funding donor has had their name cast in metal to provide a lasting record of their connection with this chapter in Cody Dock’s history.",
